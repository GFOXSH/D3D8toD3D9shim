# Supported Products

Add entries to this list if they run at all using the D3D8 to D3D9 shim and remain playable/usable without crashing (crashes are okay if you note them as known issues and they either have good workarounds or are not required to get the full playability/usability out of the product).

# Known Issues

## Advent Rising (2005)

No known issues for this game.

## The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (2002)

- In the inventory, your character's paper doll model is rendered semitransparently where it shouldn't be, and the background is red instead of black
- The minimap renders all black in "local map" mode, but the map does render correctly in "world map" mode

## Unreal II: The Awakening (2003)

- Character shadows seem to flicker (looks like some sort of Z or Stencil fighting)
- Crash in game when changing resolutions.
  - Workaround: You can simply set the desired resolution without the shim, and the game will remember that resolution the next time you load up the game with the shim again.

## Unreal Tournament 2004 (2004)

No known issues for this game.
